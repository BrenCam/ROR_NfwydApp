<h3><a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/07/best-correction-ever">Best correction ever?</a></h3>

<p>On July 17, 1969, The New York Times <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/arts/spacecorrection.pdf">issued a correction</a> related to an editorial the paper published in 1920 that dismissed the idea of rocket travel in the vacuum of space. The editorial read, in part:</p>

<blockquote><p>That Professor Goddard, with his 'chair' in Clark College and the countenancing of the Smithsonian Institution, does not know the relation of action to reaction, and of the need to have something better than a vacuum against which to react -- to say that would be absurd. Of course he only seems to lack the knowledge ladled out daily in high school.</p></blockquote>

<p>The correction stated:</p>

<blockquote><p>Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Issac Newton in the 17th Century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The Times regrets the error.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Times regrets the error! Wish I'd written that next to a few muffed physics exam questions. <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1846/how-do-rockets-work-in-the-vacuum-of-space">Here's a pretty good explanation</a> of why rockets work in vacuums.

<h2><a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/07/apollo-11-live-tv-coverage">Apollo 11 landing on TV as it aired 40 years ago</a></h2>

<p>Inspired by the <a href="http://twitter.com/ApolloPlus40">ApolloPlus40 Twitter account</a> and <a href="http://wechoosethemoon.org/">We Choose the Moon</a>, both of which are tracking the Apollo 11 mission as it happened 40 years ago, I've built <a href="http://kottke.org/apollo-11/">a page where you can watch the CBS News coverage of Walter Cronkite reporting on the Moon landing and the first moon walk</a>, 40 years to the second after it originally happened.</p>

<p><a href="http://kottke.org/apollo-11/"><img src="http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/images/apollo-tv-poster.jpg" width="500" height="379" border="0" alt="Apollo 11 on TV" /></a></p>

<p>Just leave <a href="http://kottke.org/apollo-11/">this page</a> open in your browser and at the appointed times (schedule is below), the broadcast will begin (no manual page refresh necessary).</p>

<p><strong>Schedule:</strong><br />
Moon landing broacast start: 4:10:30 pm EDT on July 20<br />
Moon landing shown: 4:17:40 pm EDT<br />
Moon landing broadcast end: 4:20:15 pm EDT<br />
Moon walk broadcast start: 10:51:27 pm EDT<br />
First step on Moon: 10:56:15 pm EDT<br />
Nixon speaks to the Eagle crew: approx 11:51:30 pm EDT<br />
Moon walk broadcast end: 12:00:30 pm EDT on July 21</p>

<p>If you've never seen this coverage, I urge you to watch at least the landing segment (~10 min.) and the first 10-20 minutes of the Moon walk. I hope that with the old time TV display and poor YouTube quality, you get a small sense of how someone 40 years ago might have experienced it. I've watched the whole thing a couple of times while putting this together and I'm struck by two things: 1) how it's almost more amazing that hundreds of millions of people watched the first Moon walk *live* on TV than it is that they got to the Moon in the first place, and 2) that pretty much the sole purpose of the Apollo 11 Moon walk was to photograph it and broadcast it live back to Earth.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.megnut.com">Meg</a> for her JS help...any errors or sloppy code are mine. Please note that schedule times are approximate, based on your computer's clock, and that the syncing of the videos might not be perfect. You need to have JS and Flash 8+ to view. This is just like real TV...if you miss the appointed time, there's no rewind or anything...the video is playing "live". I have not done extensive browser testing so it may not work perfectly in your browser. Bug reports are welcome and I will try to fix things as they crop up. If you run into any problems, just reload the page. To ensure that you have the latest (hopefully bug-free) version before the broadcast begins, reload the page. Other than that, if you leave it open, the broadcast will happen automatically.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/07/renting-books-on-the-kindle">Renting books on the Kindle</a></h3>

<p>If you still need proof that electronic media that continually phones home -- DRM'd and otherwise -- cannot be owned and is actually just rented, read on. Due to a publisher change of heart, <a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/17/some-e-books-are-more-equal-than-others/">Amazon went into some of their customers' Kindles and erased "purchased" books</a> written by an author with a certain familiarity with similar actions (click through to see who).</p>

<blockquote><p>This is ugly for all kinds of reasons. Amazon says that this sort of thing is "rare," but that it can happen at all is unsettling; we've been taught to believe that e-books are, you know, just like books, only better. Already, we've learned that they're not really like books, in that once we're finished reading them, we can't resell or even donate them. But now we learn that all sales may not even be final.</p></blockquote>

<p>This stinks like old cheese. I wish they'd just call these Kindle book transactions what they are, but I guess "Rent now with 1-Click&reg; until we decide to take it back from you or maybe not" doesn't fit neatly on a button.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/07/rationing-healthcare">Rationing healthcare</a></h3>

<p>Can you put a dollar value on a human life? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/magazine/19healthcare-t.html?pagewanted=all">Peter Singer writes</a> that the US needs to do just that if we're serious about making our healthcare system work.</p>

<blockquote><p>You have advanced kidney cancer. It will kill you, probably in the next year or two. A drug called Sutent slows the spread of the cancer and may give you an extra six months, but at a cost of $54,000. Is a few more months worth that much?</p><p>If you can afford it, you probably would pay that much, or more, to live longer, even if your quality of life wasn't going to be good. But suppose it's not you with the cancer but a stranger covered by your health-insurance fund. If the insurer provides this man - and everyone else like him - with Sutent, your premiums will increase. Do you still think the drug is a good value? Suppose the treatment cost a million dollars. Would it be worth it then? Ten million? Is there any limit to how much you would want your insurer to pay for a drug that adds six months to someone's life? If there is any point at which you say, "No, an extra six months isn't worth that much," then you think that health care should be rationed.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/07/new-photos-of-the-apollo-landing-sites">I said yesterday</a> that NASA would be taking some new photos of the Apollo landing sites with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Turns out that happened pretty quickly...<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/multimedia/lroimages/apollosites.html">they just released photos of the Apollo 11, 14, 15, 16, and 17 sites</a>.

<p>The lunar module is the small white bit in the middle casting the long shadow. The Apollo 14 site is the coolest...you can see the path the astronauts took out to some scientific instruments. The LRO hasn't reached its final orbit yet so future images "will have two to three times greater resolution". !!!

<h2><a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/07/the-giant-apollo-11-post">The giant Apollo 11 post</a></h2>

<p>Yesterday was the 40th anniversary of the launch of Apollo 11 and Monday is the same for both the first Moon landing and the first walk on the surface. In this entry, I've collected some of the best resources on the web related to the anniversary...articles, historical documents, audio, video, transcripts, photos, and the like. Enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="http://wechoosethemoon.org/">We Choose the Moon</a> is tracking the activities of the Apollo 11 mission as it happened 40 years ago. Very nicely done.</p>

<p>Housed on NASA's history site is <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.html">a ton of resources about the Apollo 11 landing</a>, including <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.landing.html">an annotated transript of the landing</a>, which makes for really interesting reading. MP3 files are also available as are <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/video11.html">many, many video clips of the landing at the astronauts' time on the surface</a>. Highlights: <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/A11Landing.mov">this video</a> was shot out of the window of the lunar module from a height of 50,000 feet until one minute after touchdown and I've never seen Armstrong's first step on the Moon <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11f1092206.mov">from this angle before</a>.</p>

<p>For its July 21, 1969 issue, The NY Times used 96 pt. type to declare that <a href="http://kottke.org/08/11/obama-is-big-news-at-the-ny-times">MEN WALK ON MOON</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The landing was made four miles west of the aiming point, but well within the designated area. An apparent error in some data fed into the craft's guidance computer from the earth was said to have accounted for the discrepancy.</p><p>Suddenly the astronauts were startled to see that the computer was guiding them toward a possibly disastrous touchdown in a boulder-filled crater about the size of a football field.</p><p>Mr. Armstrong grabbed manual control of the vehicle and guided it safely over the crater to a smoother spot, the rocket engine stirring a cloud of moon dust during the final seconds of descent.</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="http://www.kottke.org/plus/misc/images/apollo-11-01.gif" width="500" height="371" alt="Apollo 11" /></p>

<p>The Onion used larger type and <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/rlongpre01/moon.html">took a more unadulterated and profane approach</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIkHLO93lCA">love the video version</a>).</p>

<p>John Noble Wilford, the Times journalist who wrote the front page story underneath the 96 pt. type -- "the biggest single story of my career" -- recounts his Apollo 11 experience and ponders the Apollo program's legacy <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/14/science/space/14mission.html?pagewanted=all">in a great piece for the Times</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>It then occurs to me that if Columbus and Capt. James Cook were alive, they might be less astonished by two men landing on the Moon than by the millions of people, worldwide, watching every step of the walk as it happens. Exploring is old, but instantaneous telecommunications is new and marvelous.</p><p>In just 1.3 seconds, the time it takes for radio waves to travel the 238,000 miles from Moon to Earth, each step by Armstrong and Aldrin is seen, and their voices heard, throughout the world they have for the time being left behind. In contrast to exploration's previous landfalls, the whole world shares in this moment.</p></blockquote>

<p>In piece published on the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/15/AR2009071502940.html">Buzz Aldrin advocates not a return to the Moon but a mission to Mars</a> with the objective of establishing a colony on the red planet.</p>

<blockquote><p>Let the lunar surface be the ultimate global commons while we focus on more distant and sustainable goals to revitalize our space program. Our next generation must think boldly in terms of a goal for the space program: Mars for America's future. I am not suggesting a few visits to plant flags and do photo ops but a journey to make the first homestead in space: an American colony on a new world.</p><p>Robotic exploration of Mars has yielded tantalizing clues about what was once a water-soaked planet. Deep beneath the soils of Mars may lie trapped frozen water, possibly with traces of still-extant primitive life forms. Climate change on a vast scale has reshaped Mars. With Earth in the throes of its own climate evolution, human outposts on Mars could be a virtual laboratory to study these vast planetary changes. And the best way to study Mars is with the two hands, eyes and ears of a geologist, first at a moon orbiting Mars and then on the Red Planet's surface.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouRbkBAOGEw&amp;fmt=18">Video of John F. Kennedy's "we choose to go to the Moon" speech</a> given at Rice University on September 12, 1962. Fewer than 7 years later, Apollo 11 achieved the goal that Kennedy laid out in that speech.</p>

<p>In a piece for New Scientist, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327162.500-apollo-special-the-loneliest-museum.html?full=true">Linda Geddes writes about possible future lunar parks</a> and how they might be preserved.</p>

<blockquote><p>Around these [landing sites] are scattered smaller artefacts and personal items, such as Neil Armstrong's boots and portable life-support system, scientific instruments and their power generators -- and, of course, the iconic US flag which remains planted in the moon's surface. Then there are the footprints and rover tread paths. Despite the passing of the years, these remain carved into the dust because the moon has no wind or rain to wash them away.</p><p>Anthropologist P. J. Capelotti of Penn State University in Abington has mapped out five "lunar parks". These cover the areas where the majority of the artefacts are concentrated and could be used as a basis for future preservation efforts. "Nobody's saying that the whole moon has to be off limits, but as people are starting to make plans for tourism and mineral extraction, or for putting a base there, they just need to be aware of them and work around them."</p></blockquote>

<p>Since returning from the Moon, Neil Armstrong has been less and less willing to speak in public about his Apollo 11 experience. For the 40th anniversary, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/jul/15/neil-armstrong-nasa-apollo-event">Armstrong will not take part in the NASA event to commemorate the landing</a>. His only appearance related to the anniversary will be a 15-minute lecture at a Smithsonian Institution event on Sunday night. I found <a href="http://www.nasm.si.edu/events/eventDetail.cfm?eventID=1378">this event</a> on the National Air and Space Museum site...maybe that's it? If so, then Armstrong's lecture will be webcast live on the NASA TV site that evening.</p>

<p>Popular Science shares <a href="http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-amp-space/article/2009-06/40-years-later-ten-things-you-didnt-know-about-apollo-ii-moon-landing">a list of ten things you didn't know about the Apollo 11 Moon landing</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>7. When Buzz Aldrin joined Armstrong on the surface, he had to make sure not to lock the Eagle's door because there was no outer handle.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.moonwalkone.com/">Moonwalk One</a> is a documentary film about Apollo released in 1970 to little fanfare, even though it won an award at the Cannes Film Festival. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonwalk_One">The film</a> was commissioned by NASA but with so much Apollo activity and information happening in the late 60s and early 70s, no one was interested in distributing or seeing the film and it was soon forgotten. Recently, the only remaining 35mm print of the film was located under the director's desk, restored, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002BFLMVS/ref=nosim/0sil8">offered for sale on DVD</a> in time for the 40th anniversary.</p>

<p>To get a feel of what it was like in the Soviet Union during the Apollo 11 mission, <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=apollo-moon-khrushchev">Scientific American interviewed Sergei Khrushchev</a>, son of former Russian premier Nikita Khrushchev. The reaction was somewhat more subdued than in other parts of the world.</p>

<blockquote><p>Of course, you cannot have people land on the moon and just say nothing. It was published in all the newspapers. But if you remember [back then] when Americans spoke of the first man in space, they were always talking of "the first American in space" [not Yuri Gagarin]. The same feeling was prevalent in Russia. There were small articles when Apollo 11 was launched. Actually, there was a small article on the first page of Pravda and then three columns on page five. I looked it up again.</p></blockquote>

<p>Eat Me Daily <a href="http://www.eatmedaily.com/2009/07/food-of-the-apollo-11-lunar-landing/">explores the food consumed on the mission</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Apollo crew even dined on thermo-stabilized cheddar cheese spread and hot dogs during the moon mission, bringing at least a bit of America in July to the sterile flight craft. And yes, there was bacon - foreshadowing the current bacon craze, the first meal eaten by man on the moon was none other than bacon cubes, coated with gelatin to combat crumbs.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1969-07-26">The issue of the New Yorker published just after the Moon landing</a> is worth a look: <a href="http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1969-07-26#folio=024">much of the Talk of the Town section</a> is devoted to the landing and there's also <a href="http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1969-07-26#folio=084">a Letter from the Space Center</a>. (Subscribers only.)</p>

<p>The main NASA site has <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/apollo11_landing/index.html">an interactive feature to explore the landing site and Eagle</a> (Eagle was the name of the lunar module).</p>

<p>Finally, there's still some good stuff to be had on the old telly on Monday. The History Channel has <a href="http://www.history.com/shows.do?action=detail&amp;episodeId=469922">As It Happened: Man on the Moon</a> at 8pm ET:</p>

<blockquote><p>This special takes viewers back to July 1969 to experience the actual CBS News/Walter Cronkite coverage of man's first lunar landing. Using minimal editing and leaving the original footage untouched viewers will feel as if they are watching the CBS coverage in July of 1969. While today we know the outcome of Apollo 11's mission it was not a given then. This will become evident watching Walter Cronkite and his colleagues as they watch the historic lunar mission unfold before them.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/07/new-photos-of-the-apollo-landing-sites">New photos of the Apollo landing sites</a></h3>

<p>Hmm, I was just wondering about this the other day: <a href="http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/090715-apollo-landing-site.html">NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is going to take photos of some of the Apollo landing sites</a>, including where Apollo 11 landed.</p>

<blockquote><p>Lunar archaeologists, interested in making the Apollo 11 site a National Historic Landmark, hope the planned photos will answer some of these longstanding questions: What is the condition of Tranquility Base after 40 years? Was the American flag blown over on the Eagle's ascent and is it now a bleached skeleton? What are the relatively long term effects of the lunar environment on human artifacts?</p></blockquote>

<p>This should quiet the people who still think it was all a hoax...although NASA could be faking these photos as well.</p>

<p>In the Chronicle of Higher Education, <a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v55/i41/41cowenautism.htm">Tyler Cowen argues that society in general and academia in particular is prejudiced with respect to people with autism and that autism in the academy can be an advantage</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Autism is often described as a disease or a plague, but when it comes to the American college or university, autism is often a competitive advantage rather than a problem to be solved. One reason American academe is so strong is because it mobilizes the strengths and talents of people on the autistic spectrum so effectively. In spite of some of the harmful rhetoric, the on-the-ground reality is that autistics have been very good for colleges, and colleges have been very good for autistics.</p></blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/07/consider-the-gyro">Consider the gyro</a></h3>

<p>Those spinning meat cylinders and the sandwiches that emerge from them...<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/dining/15gyro.html?pagewanted=all">where did they come from</a>? From something like <a href="http://video.nytimes.com/video/playlist/style/1194811622321/index.html">this factory in Chicago</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The process starts with boxes of raw beef and lamb trimmings, and ends with what looks like oversized Popsicles the shade of a Band-Aid. In between, the meat is run through a four-ton grinder, where bread crumbs, water, oregano and other seasonings are added. A clumpy paste emerges and is squeezed into a machine that checks for metal and bone. ("You can never be too careful," Mr. Tomaras said.) Hydraulic pressure -- 60 pounds per square inch -- is used to fuse the meat into cylinders, which are stacked on trays and then rolled into a flash freezer, where the temperature is 20 degrees below zero.</p></blockquote>

<p>But forget how they're made...how do you pronounce the damn word? The article gives what I would guess is the proper pronounciation of gyro: YEE-ro. I've ordered gyros using this pronounciation and have sometimes gotten confused looks in return. Alternate pronounciations that have worked in various situations include YUR-o, GEE-ro, JI-ro, and GUY-ro. The last pronounciation somehow seems the least correct to me but yields the best results. Somehow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzatziki">tzatziki</a> is a lot easier.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/07/how-to-read-infinite-jest">How to read Infinite Jest</a></h2>

<p>A few weeks ago, I wrote <a href="http://infinitesummer.org/archives/277">the foreword for Infinite Summer</a>, a summer-long collective read of Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace's big-ass novel and one of my favorite books. That piece was actually my second draft. My first attempt was a list of advice on reading the novel...the submission of which prompted InfSum's dungeon master, Matthew Baldwin, to write back with a frowny face and a pointer to <a href="http://infinitesummer.org/archives/215">this piece</a> published -- unbeknownst to me (I have the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/time-machine.html">Time Machine</a> backups to prove it!) -- the day before I submitted my draft.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's that first draft on how to read Infinite Jest:</p>

<p>1. If you haven't already, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316066524?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=infsum-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316066524">buy the book</a>, get it from <a href="http://www.publiclibraries.com/">your local library</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000S1M9LY">download to your Kindle</a>. I got my copy in 2001 at a local San Francisco bookstore; I bought it used along with a used copy of Don DeLillo's Underworld (which I started but never finished). I was upset at something that day and purchased the books as a sort of Fuck You to whatever it was that was pissing me off. "Oh yeah? Well, I'm gonna read both of these huge books. Fuck You!" Best $10.80 I ever spent.</p>

<p>2. Warning! This book contains several footnotes. Hundreds, in fact. They run on, at a very small point size, for almost 100 pages at the conclusion of the main text. One of the footnotes, which contains the complete filmography of a fictional filmmaker, goes for more than 8 pages and itself has 6 footnotes. Every single oh-my-God-this-thing-is-a-doorstop review of IJ since 1996 has trumpeted this fact so you're probably already up to speed re: the footnotes but I didn't want you to be caught unawares or pants down.</p>

<p>3. You're going to want to but don't skip the footnotes. They are important. Yes, even the filmography one.</p>

<p>4. Physically, Infinite Jest is a large book: 2.2 inches thick and, according to Amazon.com, has a shipping weight of 3.2 pounds. Some readers have found it useful to rip the book in half for easier reading on the subway or on the beach. If you do this, you also need to tear the footnotes from the back half and tape them to front half. This technique has the side effect of giving you the appearance of A Very Serious Reader of Infinite Jest, which will either keep onlookers' questions to a minimum or maximum, depending on the onlooker.</p>

<p>5. If you opt not to destroy your copy of IJ, you should use the three bookmark method. One bookmark for where you are in the main text, another for your current footnote location, and a third for page 223, which lists the years covered by the novel in chonological order, from the Year of the Whopper (which corresponds to 2002) to the Year of Glad (2010). To say that IJ skips around quite a bit chronologically is an understatement, so keeping the timeline straight is important.</p>

<p>6. Along with the footnotes, another thing that most reviews mention w/r/t Wallace is his use of words that appear rarely outside of dictionaries. If you get stuck, keep a dictionary handy or consult one of the following online collections: <a href="http://lexicon.griffinandhoxie.com/">the David Foster Wallace Dictionary</a>, <a href="http://dfwwords.wordpress.com/">Words I Learned From Reading David Foster Wallace</a>, and <a href="http://erasing.org/etc/ij_glossary/">the Infinite Jest Vocabulary Glossary</a>.</p>

<p>7. Get a copy of Greg Carlisle's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0976146533">Elegant Complexity</a>, *the* reference book for Infinite Jest. Reading EC's notes for each IJ section after you finish will greatly increase your understanding and enjoyment of the book. <a href="http://www.hipsterbookclub.com/reviews/copy/1207/elegant_complexity_greg_carlisle.html">Here's an informative review of the guide</a>. As a bonus: "The book is 99% spoiler-free for first-time readers of Infinite Jest."</p>

<p>8. Finally, you may have heard or read that <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-wallace14-2008sep14,0,246155.story">Wallace committed suicide</a> last year. He was 46 and left a wife and dogs and at least <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/03/09/090309fa_fact_max?currentPage=all">one unpublished novel</a> and a vast literary legacy. This will be difficult, but try not to think too much about the suicide and Wallace's life-long struggle with depression while reading Infinite Jest. The book is undoubtably autobiographical in some aspects -- tennis: check; addiction: check; depression: check; grammar: check -- but a strict reading of IJ as a window into Wallace's troubled soul is a disservice to its thematic richness.</p>

<p>The great thing about Infinite Jest is that it begins at the end, so even though you're only a few pages in at this point, you already know how the whole thing is going to end. So get to it, it'll be easier than you think. I wish you way more than luck.</p>

<p>Using a link to his Twitter account from his blog, <a href="http://dustincurtis.com/you_should_follow_me_on_twitter.html">Dustin Curtis tested the effect of language on clickthrough rates</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Making the phrase more direct and personal by adding the words "you should" increased the clickthrough rate by 38% to 10.09%.</p></blockquote>

<p>Curtis started out with "I'm on <a href="http://twitter.com/kottkedotorg">twitter</a>" and eventually increased the clickthrough rate by more than double by changing the wording to "You should follow me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/kottkedotorg">here</a>."

<p><a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2009/07/i-get-by-with-a-little-help-from-94552-friends.html">Matt Haughey reflects</a> on running <a href="http://metafilter.com">MetaFilter</a> for ten years. MeFi in the early-to-mid 00s was a cesspool; Matt deserves several gold stars for pushing through, somehow making the site better than it ever was in the early days, and turning the site into a thriving business. Over the years as community fads have changed online, people moved from wanting to build their own Slashdot to Gawker to Digg to Facebook to Twitter, but MeFi as a model of online community deserves more scrutiny...people should be trying to make their own MetaFilters but nobody really does.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's to you and The Blue, Matt. Congrats!</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/07/what-fast-looks-like">What fast looks like</a></h2>

<p>People like to go fast and film themselves doing so. Modern technology offers a variety of ways to both go faster than ever before and record that speed for posterity. But for something to look fast on video, there needs to be a frame of reference for the viewer -- something to hurtle past or whoosh by -- and maybe even a hint of danger. Here are a selection of videos of people doing just that: traveling at high speeds in cars, on train tracks, through the air, and down mountains in close proximity to traffic, large rocks, and thin atmospheres. Most of these videos are filmed from a first-person perspective so that when you watch them, you can imagine that you're the one zooming along.</p>

<p>In 1976, Claude Lelouch mounted a camera on the front of his Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 and drove through the streets of Paris -- running red lights, jumping curbs and possibly reaching speeds upwards of 120 mph -- before reaching his date near the Sacr&eacute; Coeur. The result is the film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%27%C3%A9tait_un_rendez-vous">C'&eacute;tait un rendez-vous</a>, <strong>8 uncut minutes of insane urban driving</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Base jumpers equipped with wingsuits can glide very fast</strong> very close to the ground. Perhaps the most insane videos on the page...they're not doing 1200 mph or anything, but they are awfully close to the ground with few safety options if they slip up.</p>

<p>The lads at Top Gear took <strong>the Bugatti Veyron to its top speed of 253 mph</strong> on a test track. The test driver seems to have had what I would term a religious experience at the top speed.</p>

<p><strong>240 mph on a Suzuki Hayabusa motorcycle</strong>. Oh, and he does a wheelie from 70 to 140 mph. (Note: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_Hayabusa">Wikipedia says the bike</a> has an "electronically restricted" top speed of 188 mph. Either the owner a) removed the restriction, or b) tweaked the speedometer to display higher than normal speeds.)</p>

<p>At six, Hannah Clark received a heart transplant...but they kept the second heart in her chest as well. Ten years later, her new heart failed and <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17460-girl-with-two-hearts-healthy-after-loss-of-one.html">they were able to remove it because her old heart had mended itself in the meantime</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>For the first few months, the new heart did nearly all the work, but this "rest" gave Hannah's own heart a chance to begin recovery. By the time of the second heart was finally removed, Hannah's heart was doing virtually all the work itself.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's amazing what doctors can entice the human body to do.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/07/an-intuitive-expression-of-liquid-intelligence">An intuitive expression of liquid intelligence</a></h3>

<p>Photographer <a href="http://www.paulgrahamarchive.com/">Paul Graham</a> <a href="http://www.americansuburbx.com/2009/07/theory-paul-graham-photography-is-easy.html">writes about</a> what's so easy:</p>

<blockquote><p>It's simply a way of recording what you see -- point the camera at it, and press a button. How hard is that? And what's more, in this digital age, its free -- doesn't even cost you the price of film. It's so simple and basic, it's ridiculous.</p></blockquote>

<p>and difficult about photography:</p>

<blockquote><p>It's so difficult because it's everywhere, every place, all the time, even right now. It's the view of this pen in my hand as I write this, it's an image of your hands holding this book, Drift your consciousness up and out of this text and see: it's right there, across the room -- there... and there. Then it's gone. You didn't photograph it, because you didn't think it was worth it. And now it's too late, that moment has evaporated.</p></blockquote>

<p>Graham also describes photography as "an intuitive expression of liquid intelligence", which seems an apt expression of creativity in general. (via <a href="http://blog.noahkalina.com/">noah kalina</a>)</p>
