              <p>This is the last instalment of the holiday posts. Read <a href="http://semanticallydriven.com/2009/07/post_holiday_post.html">part 1</a>, <a href="http://semanticallydriven.com/2009/07/post_holiday_post_-_part_2.html">part 2</a> and <a href="http://semanticallydriven.com/2009/07/currumbin_wildlife_sanctuary.html">part 3</a> if you so desire.</p>
<p>After a busy day at Currumbin and a late night (11pm) seeing the glow worms we got ready to do our last theme park - Movie World. Arriving at Movie World the first thing you see is a scary looking Batman ride where you get sent up in the air very very quickly and come down and then go back up while gradually slowing down. The scariest bit is the first time you come down because you feel like you&#8217;re going to leave the seat and it feels a bit unsafe but we did it twice anyway. My tough son JJ informed me that he no longer felt that scary feeling in the tummy.</p>
<p><a title="Movie World" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3727476495/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/2573/3727476495_6de66e1284.jpg" alt="Movie World" width="449" height="299" class="left" /></a></p>
<p>I wish we&#8217;d gone to do some other rides before it got busier. We missed out on the Scooby Doo scary ride and also the Superman roller coaster because of 45+ minute waits.</p>
<p>I did meet Scooby Doo and Shaggy though. JJ didn&#8217;t want his photo taken with them so he took this one.</p>
<p><a title="Scooby Doo and Shaggy" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3727483535/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/2665/3727483535_a274e24aa5.jpg" alt="Scooby Doo and Shaggy" width="450" height="300" class="left" /></a></p>
<p>We also managed to see the Hollywood Stunt Drivers show which was quite entertaining but a bit smelly from all that burnt rubber.</p>
<p><a title="Stunt driving" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3727478275/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/2585/3727478275_bf4a2c186c.jpg" alt="Stunt driving" width="451" height="300" class="left" /></a></p>
<p>We squeezed in a Loony Tunes show - not that entertaining for me but the young kids liked it. Shrek 4D was pretty good and luckily we had the ponchos to wear for the Wild West ride.</p>
<p><a title="Wild West ride - the part where you get really wet" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3727489539/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/2537/3727489539_cfe4f0c356.jpg" alt="Wild West ride - the part where you get really wet" width="451" height="300" class="left" /></a></p>
<p>Friday night was our last night at the Gold Coast and I went out to dinner with some people I&#8217;d met while our kids were in the kids club - yay for the kids club.</p>
<p>Saturday morning we packed up, checked out and walked down the road to the hire car place and drove south to Yamba in northern New South Wales where my aunt lives. She&#8217;d said it would take about two hours but by the time we fluffed around a bit and got stuck in the Ballina bypass roadworks it took more like three hours. The last time I drove on the Pacific Highway was 12 years ago on my road trip with three gay boys. I must write about that one day.</p>
<p>Unless I was a surfer which I&#8217;m not Yamba probably wouldn&#8217;t have been on my radar to visit normally but it&#8217;s a beautiful spot and the view from the pub over the ocean is spectacular.</p>
<p>Because we&#8217;d spent most of the day in the car I took JJ for a walk and happened upon some fishermen cleaning up fish and throwing what they didn&#8217;t want to these pelicans at the Yamba Bay boat ramp. I love pelicans and could just watch them for ages fighting over fish.</p>
<p><a title="Pelicans" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3734009480/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/2638/3734009480_38621626d7.jpg" alt="Pelicans" width="450" height="300" class="left" /></a></p>
<p>Even though I&#8217;m not a surfer we went to Angourie - near Yamba - and watched some people surfing.</p>
<p><a title="Surfing at Angourie" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3734020388/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/3522/3734020388_be47db350a.jpg" alt="Surfing at Angourie" width="449" height="299" class="left" /></a></p>
<p>After spending the weekend at my aunt&#8217;s we took our time heading back up to the Gold Coast to catch the plane back to Adelaide. We stopped in Byron Bay for lunch and the other two or three times I was there was obviously not during the school holidays as I&#8217;ve never seen the streets so busy.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, our holiday was really good. JJ and I travel well together and while I enjoyed the Gold Coast bit I also enjoyed the driving component and I would have liked to stop and explore more places for longer. Maybe we&#8217;ll hop in the Nissan one day and go driving interstate.</p>

              <p>The main reason I wanted to go to Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary was to see all the rainbow lorikeets but we were there too late and had to leave to early for them so I missed out. They come into feed about 8.30-9 in the morning and about 4 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>We did, however, see a heap of other wildlife. I would have liked to hold a koala but it appeared as though you had to buy the accompanying photo for that and there was a queue. Oh well, I&#8217;ve held a koala before.</p>
<p>Even though we were there for a few hours we still missed out on various shows that were held around the place that talked about different types of animals. The one show that we did see, which was great, was the bird show.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some pictures of the birds, and watch out for your head as they fly around.</p>
<p><a title="Currumbin bird show" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3718561612/"><img class="left" src="http://static.flickr.com/2643/3718561612_5c9d70363c.jpg" alt="Currumbin bird show" width="450" height="291" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Owl" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3717754795/"><img class="left" src="http://static.flickr.com/2621/3717754795_da71de4686.jpg" alt="Owl" width="450" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Toucan" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3718595056/"><img class="left" src="http://static.flickr.com/2528/3718595056_5c174b7758.jpg" alt="Toucan" width="451" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>They are so well trained and the show runs like clockwork, it was a pleasure to see.</p>
<p>We got to pat kangaroos as they lay on the ground, and while we didn&#8217;t hold a koala there were plenty of them there.</p>
<p><a title="Koala bear" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3718599064/"><img class="left" src="http://static.flickr.com/3510/3718599064_8d5b926b2b.jpg" alt="Koala bear" width="449" height="299" /></a></p>
<p>These crocodiles looked like statues until I saw some of their eyes open.</p>
<p><a title="Sleeping" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3717795899/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/2497/3717795899_7d995e0a57.jpg" alt="Sleeping" width="451" height="300" class="left" /></a></p>
<p>And I&#8217;m glad this fella was behind strong wire, although he was pretty sleepy and quite well fed looking.</p>
<p><a title="Never smile at a crocodile" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3718615136/"><img class="left" src="http://static.flickr.com/2574/3718615136_273f6857d8.jpg" alt="Never smile at a crocodile" class="left" /></a></p>
<p>The little train that ran around the park had always just left as we arrived at a stop and it was quicker to keep walking than to wait 20 minutes for the next one.</p>
<p>I even went into the reptile bit and watched a snake try to peel his skin off. The photo I took didn&#8217;t work out due to poor light conditions and I didn&#8217;t want to frighten his skin off with my flash.</p>
<p>I noticed here, and at the glow worms we saw in the evening (a separate trip) that Japanese tourists were wearing masks over their face because of a swine flu threat I presume. I wonder if they were the ones who were brave enough to come to Australia and they left a lot of others at home. Have tourism numbers dropped? I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Even though Currumbin was a fair distance from our hotel, we were able to hop on a bus and go straight there. Public transport is quite easy in Surfer&#8217;s Paradise and I&#8217;d bought a package that included airport and theme park transfers and public transport. We ended up using public transport for the theme parks as it also left almost from our hotel and we weren&#8217;t bound by pickup and drop off times.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m getting there with the post holiday posts. There&#8217;s three days left.</p>

              <p>Read <a href="http://semanticallydriven.com/2009/07/post_holiday_post.html">post holiday post part 1</a> for the beginning.</p>
<p>For the holiday to the Gold Coast I&#8217;d bought a theme park fun pass to the three Warner Bros theme parks, Seaworld (which we&#8217;d just done), Wet&#8217;nWild and Movie World. The fun pass lasts for five days from the first day you use it so you can do each park with a rest day inbetween. This is what I&#8217;d recommend for sure as these parks are huge and involve a lot of walking.</p>
<p>After a rest day on Tuesday with watching Ice Age 3 in 3D we were up for theme park number two. The weather wasn&#8217;t looking that great  for the whole week so I just decided to get Wet&#8217;nWild out the way. It was a bit cool, about 17 degrees and overcast and fairly windy and I traipsed around the park in my wet bathers - after the first ride anyway. With no firm plan in mind we started off with the Tornado. This ride means you have to lug a large and fairly heavy raft thing up heaps of stairs and it&#8217;s hard to do with just one adult and one kid. We were really struggling but luckily someone came to our rescue and helped me carry it up.</p>
<p>JJ got on it and went down. I was in front off JJ as we backed down the last chute before we went into the main tornado bit and the scared look on his face was priceless - I wish I could have captured it on film. That feeling of not being in control of what comes next is what makes these rides so much fun in retrospect.</p>
<p><a title="The Tornado" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3699922247/"><img class="left" src="http://static.flickr.com/2546/3699922247_678353dfde.jpg" alt="The Tornado" width="451" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>We went around the park and systematically did most of the rides with a  couple of spa visits inbetween to warm up as it was pretty chilly. It&#8217;s not really worth taking a towel around with you because it would just get wet and you wouldn&#8217;t be that warm with a wet towel either. We hired a locker to put all our stuff in and got the waterproof wristband with a bit of extra money on it to buy food. We ate a lot of chips on our holidays as these theme parks idea of healthy food is pretty non-existent and Wet&#8217;nWild had the best hot chips and we hooked into them like there was no tomorrow when we got them. All that climbing up numerous amounts of stairs made for two very hungry people.</p>
<p>The Black Hole was our favourite. It&#8217;s pitch black inside these tunnels but it wasn&#8217;t too scary and it was warm in there. I imagine in the heat of summer it&#8217;s too warm, but in winter it was perfect. We did it twice at the beginning and once or twice before I changed back into warm clothes.</p>
<p><a title="The Black Hole - our favourite" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3700727552/"><img class="left" src="http://static.flickr.com/2660/3700727552_91474296b5.jpg" alt="The Black Hole - our favourite" width="449" height="299" /></a></p>
<p>A word of warning if you go down the slide that doesn&#8217;t require some sort of raft or mat to use, if you&#8217;re just wearing a normal bathing suit you go really fast. This happened to me and my legs and arms ended up flailing all over the place and I bruised both my elbows and wasn&#8217;t ready when I landed in the pool at the end and got water up my nose which wasn&#8217;t pleasant at all.</p>
<p>I was lucky that JJ is tall enough to go on all these rides - I can&#8217;t remember the height requirements but most of the rides need a pair of people as well. Like all the theme parks, there is a younger kids section too which we didn&#8217;t visit. Because of the weather though, there weren&#8217;t that many brave (stupid?) people there so we didn&#8217;t have long waits for the rides we did go on  which was a good thing. The cooler weather also meant that some of the rides alternated in their opening times.</p>
<p>After I got changed JJ went into the wave pool.</p>
<p><a title="The wave pool - Jules enjoyed this" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3699917147/"><img class="left" src="http://static.flickr.com/2547/3699917147_e2e538c00d.jpg" alt="The wave pool - Jules enjoyed this" width="449" height="311" /></a></p>
<p>There were showers in the changeroom but there was no hot water. I couldn&#8217;t believe it. I was shivering and cold and couldn&#8217;t even warm up under a warm shower. I had to wait until I got back to the hotel for that.</p>
<p>With all this exercise during our days meant I had fairly early nights during our holiday. JJ went to bed about 9pm every night and because we were in the same room I just laid on my bed reading while he went to sleep. I knew that if I put the tv on he&#8217;d watch it and never get to sleep, although on the Wednesday night he went to bed at 8.30pm and was still awake at 9pm when The Chaser started. I watched it and had to muffle my laughter to not disturb him as he was going to sleep.</p>
<p>The one thing I liked about our resort was that they provided basic shared facilities for doing your own meals if you wanted. There was a toaster and a microwave so for breakfasts I could have my toast and JJ had his cereal and that was one meal a day we didn&#8217;t have to buy. I bought snacks and some fruit from the supermarket, but other than that JJ pretty much lived on fish and chips because that&#8217;s his favourite meal which just about every establishment we ate at provided. Oh well, when on holidays&#8230;.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve got two more parts left of this holiday tale. Any questions? Please ask in the comments.</p>

              <p><a title="Waitimg at Adelaide airport" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3700697460/"><img class="left" src="http://static.flickr.com/3494/3700697460_3d2b71a991.jpg" alt="Waitimg at Adelaide airport" width="451" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Upon some reflection on our holiday, it was a damn good one. There, that&#8217;ll do won&#8217;t it? No, you want details&#8230;..</p>
<p><a title="On the cable car at Seaworld" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3699888197/"><img class="left" src="http://static.flickr.com/3489/3699888197_cdeb39aaec.jpg" alt="On the cable car at Seaworld" width="450" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>In summary, we had six days on the Gold Coast and a theme park fun pass to use within five of those days so as you can imagine we were busy. Seaworld was the first port of call because I knew that was the closest and the easiest to get to. I&#8217;d booked JJ into the Kids Club at the hotel at 4.30pm that afternoon so we had to leave about 3pm or so to get back but after having been there for five hours I was glad to leave. We traipsed around that park for those five hours and hardly sat down to just relax.</p>
<p><a title="Dolphins at Seaworld" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3700703904/"><img class="left" src="http://static.flickr.com/2594/3700703904_23c8258bb2.jpg" alt="Dolphins at Seaworld" width="451" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>We went on rides through volcanoes and tunnels that involved just a bit more water than I would have liked. We went on the corkscrew rollercoaster twice and the scariest part for me was the corkscrew part that happens twice in very quick succession. The ride is over so quickly you&#8217;re not quite sure what happened. We didn&#8217;t do the jet rider one. We saw the dolphin show, had a front row seat at the lunchtime water ski comedy 50s act. We rode the monorail twice and the skyrail once. The polar bears were asleep. I shed a tear during the dolphin show from a combination of the music and the gorgeousness of dolphins. I wondered how the dolphin trainers get a job there. Phew, we did a lot and that was just part of day 1.</p>
<p>A couple more photos below.</p>
<p><a title="Bored fish" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3700712984/"><img class="left" src="http://static.flickr.com/2516/3700712984_30b138a421.jpg" alt="Bored fish" width="451" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Water skiing tricks" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3699908045/"><img class="left" src="http://static.flickr.com/3655/3699908045_09968b92c3.jpg" alt="Water skiing tricks" width="450" height="299" /></a></p>
<p>Rewind to the day before though. We left home at 7.30am to catch the plane after having spent the previous afternoon at an AFL football match. It&#8217;s hard work being a footy yobbo but I think we all played the part quite well. The direct flight from Adelaide to the Gold Coast is a good one and I wouldn&#8217;t fly there any other way unless I was absolutely desperate. We arrived at the Gold Coast just as the marathon was finishing so when I told the bus transfer desk person where we were going she said because of road closures we&#8217;d have to be dropped off at the next suburb and walk a kilometre. At first I thought she was joking but she wasn&#8217;t. When I asked the bus driver he said, no problem, he&#8217;d drop us off right round the corner and we wouldn&#8217;t have to walk a kilometre. Phew! Even with wheely suitcases, they&#8217;re quite heavy, and that&#8217;s without the hand luggage, including for some reason my laptop. All I used my laptop for was to add photos ready for uploading to Flickr and I hardly managed to do that. Laptop&#8217;s staying home next time!</p>
<p>When  we got to our room JJ was really excited to inform me that there was a hair dryer in the bathroom and I was glad to see two beds so we didn&#8217;t have to sleep together and listen to each other grind their teeth and snore. We stayed at one of those full-on kiddy/family resorts and if you were child-free you would not want to stay there because it was a festival of children. Unfortunately the children took over the spa so there was not even respite from them there. I told one kid that if he kept splashing he&#8217;d be out and it wasn&#8217;t even my own child.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49773079@N00/3699906289/"><img class="left" src="http://static.flickr.com/2615/3699906289_49646b9d32.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>When I started this post I thought I&#8217;d do a quick few sentences and pop in a few photos but it&#8217;s turned out longer than I expected and we&#8217;re only on day two.</p>
<p>Speaking of photos I took my new camera with me and I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to get some of the photos I got with my old camera. I love that I can turn the camera on and it&#8217;s ready to go very quickly. I also love the continual shoot. Now, to get off the AV setting and explore a bit more will be the next step.</p>
<p>If you want to see more photos I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaycee/sets/72157621497359650/">gradually uploading them to Flickr</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s so much more that I&#8217;ll have to save it for subsequent posts but what I do want to say before I forget is how I felt myself acting when I got back Monday evening. It was action stations and I was barking orders like a sargeant until I realised that I was only acting like that because of the horrible thought of being back in the routine and doing the daily drudge. I&#8217;m trying to change my attitude to how I react to each day from a sometimes negative one to a more positive one and to try not to sweat the small stuff. I&#8217;ve slightly changed our routine for the rest of this week and the wheels haven&#8217;t fallen off but I&#8217;m more relaxed than when I got back Monday night. Let&#8217;s wait and see what happens when school starts back, and sport, and scouts&#8230;&#8230;..</p>

              <p>I&#8217;m back from holidays and catching up on my blogging as I didn&#8217;t get a chance to do any while away. First off I&#8217;d like to say that <a href="http://www.lrkane.com/">Laura</a> (commenter no. 2) has won the <a href="http://semanticallydriven.com/reviews/ecostore_products_review_and_a_giveaway">giveaway of organic cleaning products and chocolate</a>. Laura, just send me your snail mail address and I&#8217;ll organise to get your goodies sent to you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a big user of vinegar and bi-carb for my cleaning also. I just read today that before you go on holidays you should put some vinegar down the drains. I wish I&#8217;d done that as things smelt a bit musty in the bathroom when we got back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m having a hard time adjusting to being back from holidays. We got home at 7pm last night and it was straight back to work for me today. Apparently I&#8217;ve missed a week of rain nearly every day. I certainly noticed the chillier air last night compared to being away up north. The holiday was great and it felt like we were away for longer than nine days - which is good.</p>
<p>For the post holiday post you&#8217;ll have to wait a short while.</p>

              <p>It&#8217;s pretty much mid-winter here. The weather is cold and wet outside. Inside I&#8217;ve got the fire going and am trying to dry the washing I did last night because I have to pack for our Queensland holiday. That&#8217;s right, we&#8217;re off to the Gold Coast on Sunday to have a holiday. Now that I&#8217;ve finished work, I am very excited and am trying to figure out what to pack.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just had a person round from a solar panel place to talk to me about getting solar panels on my house so I can contribute electricity back to the grid. Luckily I got in early enough before the government stopped the $8000 rebate. I&#8217;ll end up paying some money over this rebate but it will be totally worth it to get paid for electricity rather than having to fork out money for the privilege.</p>
<p>The cute salesman was very impressed that my electricity usage is quite low - about 4.5kWh consumption on average. He said that some people he sees consume about 22kWh which must mean they have everything electrical on in their house all the time. I&#8217;m so conscious that I even turn the microwave off at the powerpoint when I&#8217;m not using it. Same for the stereo, and the TV goes off at the TV rather than being left on standby. I don&#8217;t use the air conditioner until I absolutely have to and I have a habit of turning off lights in rooms that aren&#8217;t being used which is quite dangerous when you have a black dog that lies in high traffic places.</p>
<p>Enough about me, my holiday, and my electricity frugality. I have a <strong><a href="http://semanticallydriven.com/reviews/ecostore_products_review_and_a_giveaway">giveaway of &#8216;green&#8217; cleaning products and some yummy chocolate</a></strong>. You&#8217;ve got a week and a bit to enter this one by leaving a comment.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;m away for just over a week my blogging might be a bit light on during this time as I tune out of the internet and go analogue.</p>

              <p>On Friday morning I heard him get up, go to the toilet and go back to bed. I lay in bed for a bit and then yelled out &#8216;Good morning birthday boy&#8217;. He came into my room and when I asked why he hadn&#8217;t come in earlier he said that he didn&#8217;t want to wake me. It doesn&#8217;t bother him most other mornings and his birthday is one of the rare days in the year that I don&#8217;t mind if he does wake me.</p>
<p>I gave him his presents and he read the card first.</p>
<p><img class="left" title="Birthday card" src="http://semanticallydriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/img_0586.jpg" alt="Birthday card" width="450" height="440" /></p>
<p>He then opened the main present.</p>
<p><img class="left" title="First look at Nintendo DSi" src="http://semanticallydriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/img_0594.jpg" alt="First look at Nintendo DSi" width="450" height="675" /></p>
<p>He then realised what it was. He&#8217;s been hassling me for a Nintendo DS for ages and I finally caved in. I even bought the DSi.</p>
<p><img class="left" title="Realisation sets in" src="http://semanticallydriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/img_0595.jpg" alt="Realisation sets in" width="450" height="675" /></p>
<p>He opened the second part of the present which included a game.</p>
<p><img class="left" title="And the DS games comes with it" src="http://semanticallydriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/img_0602.jpg" alt="And the DS games comes with it" width="450" height="675" /></p>
<p>And before too long he was occupied playing it. I realise that now that he&#8217;s got a DSi he&#8217;ll be hassling me to play it all the time. It&#8217;s not one of those things that he can have whenever he wants and so far I think he accepts that. He asked me today if we can take it away with us, and of course we will be.</p>
<p>Just a small technical note about the DSi. It accepts an SD card so you can store music and photos on it. I would have expected that you could put the SD card into the slot and it would be recognised straight away like in a camera but this isn&#8217;t the case. You have to connect to the internet before the DSi will recognise it. I&#8217;m fairly technically savvy but I had a bitch of a time trying to connect it to the internet using my wi-fi broadband at home.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got my security setup with WPA and the default for the DSi is WEP - ie two different kinds of security. The documentation I found said that you could setup the internet with WAP security but damned if I could find it. The manual didn&#8217;t mention anything that I could find and then I finally (after nearly two hours) found that if you used connections 4-6 on the DSi you could select more than just WEP security. Finally I connected to the internet which I hadn&#8217;t really wanted to do anyway. I just wanted the thing to read the SD card.</p>

<p>My lost two hours could have been much better spent organising the birthday party for the Sunday. JJ hasn&#8217;t had a birthday party since his <a href="http://semanticallydriven.com/2006/06/happy_birthday_.html">fifth birthday</a> and that was a huge one number wise but this one felt more stressful - probably because it was at home and probably because I wasn&#8217;t quite sure how I would entertain these children for two hours.</p>
<p>Nearly half an hour after they arrived I was still the only adult there and I was starting to freak out. My friends were supposed to be there for two o&#8217;clock and they were seriously late. One of the fathers offered to stay but he had to go on a quick errand before he came back. By the time he did come back my other friends had arrived but he still stayed.</p>
<p>We started off with Pass the Parcel which was surprisingly hard work. The kids (five boys) were really over-excited and very hard to control. It was JJ times five. Note Monty in prime patting position!</p>
<p><img class="left" title="The birthday party - Pass the parcel" src="http://semanticallydriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/img_0617.jpg" alt="The birthday party - Pass the parcel" width="450" height="300" /></p>
<p>We then did musical statues outside which was great to get rid of some of that energy.</p>
<p>I found a game called Mummy Wrap on the internet and I really didn&#8217;t hold out much hope for this game because it required standing still. The boys paired up and had to wrap each other like a mummy.</p>
<p>To their credit they all did a really good job with a bit of help from some adults.</p>
<p><img class="left" title="Mummy wrap game" src="http://semanticallydriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/img_0619.jpg" alt="Mummy wrap game" width="450" height="300" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one nearly completed.</p>
<p><img class="left" title="Finished mummy wrap" src="http://semanticallydriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/img_0624.jpg" alt="Finished mummy wrap" width="450" height="675" /></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s me directing some toilet paper pickup after the first round. The toilet paper I got came apart quite easily so it was a little bit hard not to rip it.</p>
<p><img class="left" title="Picking up the rubbish" src="http://semanticallydriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/img_0628.jpg" alt="Picking up the rubbish" width="450" height="300" /></p>
<p>They then swapped and we judged the best wrapper, although they nearly all won a prize.</p>
<p>To get the toilet paper off they had to do star jumps.</p>
<p><img class="left" title="Breaking free from mummy wrap" src="http://semanticallydriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/img_0646.jpg" alt="Breaking free from mummy wrap" width="450" height="675" /></p>
<p>And then wrestle each other to the ground.</p>
<p><img class="left" title="Now they can move" src="http://semanticallydriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/img_0648.jpg" alt="Now they can move" width="450" height="300" /></p>
<p>After some food, some more jumping on the trampoline it was time for the birthday cake. JJ wanted me to make my cheesecake (the Superb Cheesecake from the Quick and Thrifty Readers Digest recipe book). I bought some Smarties so the boys could decorate their piece.</p>
<p><img class="left" title="Birthday cake (my superb cheesecake)" src="http://semanticallydriven.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/img_0650.jpg" alt="Birthday cake (my superb cheesecake)" width="450" height="300" /></p>
<p>And then they all left and I sat down and breathed a big sigh of relief. It was all worth it though because JJ had a great time and I&#8217;m pretty sure his guests had a great time too.</p>
